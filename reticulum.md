## Reticulum Network Stack

I think [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network/) is a really neat project, and I've decided to pursue it for a number of reasons. Among those are disaster preparedness, long range communication during backcountry adventures, secure communication generally/surveillance avoidance, and my general fascination with radio comms. (I chant to myself routinely about how I do *not* need a ham radio license and the accompanying hobby.) 

A particular focus of my efforts here is on beginner friendly guides for Reticulum. I think "beginner" or "low-code" information is important, so that the widest number of people can adopt a useful tool. This page will serve as an index of those documents, as well as a source of other info. 

I am independent from the creator of the project, but working on this with their permission and encouragement. I think there's significant value in an openly available low cost secure off grid messaging platform, and if I'm starting this adventure from scratch I thought I might as well document it. 

Main sites for the project: [unsigned.io](https://unsigned.io/) and [reticulum.network](https://reticulum.network/)
