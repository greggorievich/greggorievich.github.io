### Helloooo fricking world.
I think I might be making some progress, the "grab a site template and mod it" plan is looking much better than "carouse ChatGPT into building it for me".
Here soon: greggorievich's house of confusion, wherein I will document, probably, some technical guides and information about projects I'm working on. 

Bear with me the mess as I clean up this theme's default pages and customize the rest, and figure out what I'm doing generally.
