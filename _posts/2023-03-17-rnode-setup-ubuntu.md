Now that we've set up one RNode under WIndows, let's rinse and repeat on Linux, via a Ubuntu install(or in your case, maybe skip straight to this guide because you don't use Windows).

## Brief

The [RNode](https://unsigned.io/hardware/RNode.html) is a (typically) piece of hardware designed with (typically) a long range LoRa radio to facilitate communications over distance.
