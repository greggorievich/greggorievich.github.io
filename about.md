  Hey there! I'm still in the construction phase probably forever if I'm honest, but hopefully I'll have a lot more usefulness pretty quickly.

# About This Site

This site is an attempt to put some documentation online for projects I'm working on and technical info I want to document publicly. 

### Zero Assumption Documentation

One of the tenets I want to focus on when I write guides is a term I've adopted over the years - "Zero Assumption Documentation". 

I often see technical information published that doesn't take its audience into account and doesn't clarify a lot of items that it should. 

For example, the instructions to set up a printer on a network would differ greatly if I were to relay them to an IT staff member, versus my grandmother. I have a bunch of expectations for the knowledge of the IT person, and the expectation that they will ask for help in different ways than my grandma would, as well. 

This can be a fun challenge as an IT support person, and many in the trade will have stories wherein a user complains that, say, "the accounting system is broken", but in reality it's the office internet connection is offline, or something similarly unrelated. To that end user, though, those are the same thing, or the difference is irrelevant. They only use the internet connection to get to the accounting system, or they didn't do the troubleshooting to determine something else was the issue. 

And that's fine! That's _my_ job. I'm here to do the computer things, so they can do the accounting things. 

However, you have to learn not to _assume_ anything about what someone might or might not know, and learn to read between the lines. 

As such, my goal when writing public guides is to make as few assumptions like this as possible, and to do my best to declare them in advance. 

Where someone else might say something like "the easiest way to install my program is via Chocolatey" and or possibly provide the command to run:

`choco install coolprogram`

That might leave you with a lot of questions. Why isn't that command running? What the heck is Chocolatey? 

There are a lot of prerequisites, and that hypothetical author made the assumption that you knew this already. This happens a lot with tech people (our brains are wired a bit different, I think) and especially with developers.

My goal is to work with zero assumptions, or at least declare them whenever I can. In the above example, I'd explain to you that Chocolatey is a system that you can install on Windows that manages program installation for you similarly to a linux package manager might, where you can get it, and any other requirements before (or as) we get to that command. 

I don't want you to have to work through a bunch of errors that were just oversight of the documentation and trace your steps through prerequisites and learning other things without at least some guidance. There will be plenty of errors related to things actually going awry that you have to deal with. 

That's the hope, anyway. I've done a fair bit of technical writing and I think something for wide public consumption should be achievable.

## About This Human

Hi! I'm Gregg. I don't think I can make an "I am a..." sort of statement because I switch up hobbies like crazy and I'm into a ton of things at any given time. 

I imagine at some point I'll have to figure out a way to be more contactable for feedback, but I'm not quite there yet. For the time being, please use the [GitHub Discussions forum](https://github.com/greggorievich/greggorievich.github.io/discussions) for this repository. This doesn't meet my normal preference for accessibility (I don't want what I publish to be limited to the sort of person who has a GitHub account), but at least the Discussions should be viewable by everyone.
